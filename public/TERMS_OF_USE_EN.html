            <!-- ============================================================ -->
            <h2>5. Subscriptions and In-App Purchases</h2>

            <h3>5.1 Billing</h3>
            <p>All subscription payments are processed through the <strong>Apple App Store</strong> (iOS) or <strong>Google Play Store</strong> (Android). We do not directly collect or process any payment information. Pricing, billing cycles, and payment methods are governed by the respective store's terms.</p>

            <h3>5.2 Cancellation and Refunds</h3>
            <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time through your device's subscription management settings (Apple App Store or Google Play Store). Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period. Refund requests must be directed to Apple or Google, as they process all payments. We do not issue refunds directly.</p>

            <h3>5.3 Price Changes</h3>
            <p>We reserve the right to change subscription pricing. Any price changes will be communicated in advance through the App Store or Google Play Store and will take effect at the start of your next billing period following notice.</p>

            <!-- ============================================================ -->
            <h2>6. Advertising</h2>
            <p>The free version of the App displays advertisements served by <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. By using the App, you agree that we may display ads. AdMob may collect certain data (including advertising identifiers and IP-derived coarse location) to deliver personalized ads, as described in our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
            <p>On iOS, you will be asked for consent through Apple's App Tracking Transparency framework before any cross-app tracking occurs. On Android, you can adjust ad personalization in your device settings.</p>

            <!-- ============================================================ -->
            <h2>7. User Content and AI Processing</h2>

            <h3>7.1 Your Content</h3>
            <p>You retain ownership of any text you input into the App (dream descriptions, oracle questions, etc.). By submitting content, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to process that content solely for the purpose of providing the App's features to you.</p>

            <h3>7.2 AI Processing</h3>
            <p>To provide dream interpretations, oracle responses, and horoscope readings, the App sends your inputs to <strong>OpenAI's API</strong> for processing and image generation. These queries are processed in real time and are ephemeral — we do not permanently store your inputs on our servers. OpenAI may process this data according to its own policies.</p>

            <h3>7.3 AI-Generated Content</h3>
            <p>Content generated by AI, including text responses and images, is provided for entertainment only and may be inaccurate, incomplete, or inappropriate. We do not guarantee the accuracy, reliability, or suitability of AI-generated content. You use such content at your own risk.</p>
