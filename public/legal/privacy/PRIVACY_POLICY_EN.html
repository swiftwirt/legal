            </ul>

            <!-- ============================================================ -->
            <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>We use the following third-party services. Each may collect and process data as described below:</p>

            <h3>3.1 Google AdMob</h3>
            <p>We use Google AdMob to display banner advertisements. AdMob collects advertising identifiers (IDFA on iOS, Advertising ID on Android), IP address (to derive coarse location), crash data, performance data, and other diagnostic data. This information is used for third-party advertising, analytics, and ad personalization. AdMob's data collection constitutes "tracking" as defined by Apple. For more information, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

            <h3>3.2 Firebase (Google)</h3>
            <p><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> Collects app usage data for analytics purposes. You can opt out in the App's Settings. <strong>Firebase Remote Config:</strong> Delivers feature flags and configuration data to the App. <strong>Firebase Core:</strong> Provides base infrastructure services. For more information, see <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firebase Privacy Information</a>.</p>

            <h3>3.3 OpenAI</h3>
            <p>User-entered text (dream descriptions, oracle questions, and horoscope-related queries) is sent to OpenAI's API to generate AI-powered responses and images. These queries are processed in real time and are not stored by us after the response is delivered. OpenAI may process this data according to its own <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terms of Use</a>.</p>

            <h3>3.4 Apple App Store &amp; Google Play Store</h3>
            <p>All in-app purchase and subscription transactions are processed and managed entirely by Apple (App Store) or Google (Play Store). We do not receive or store your payment information (credit card numbers, billing addresses, etc.). Your purchase is subject to the respective store's terms and privacy policy.</p>

            <!-- ============================================================ -->
            <h2>4. Advertising and Tracking</h2>
            <p>The App displays advertisements served by Google AdMob. AdMob uses tracking technologies, including advertising identifiers, to deliver personalized ads and measure ad performance.</p>

            <h3>4.1 Apple App Tracking Transparency (iOS)</h3>
            <p>On iOS devices, the App will request your permission through Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework before allowing AdMob to access your IDFA for personalized advertising and cross-app tracking. You may grant or deny this permission. If you deny tracking, AdMob will serve non-personalized (contextual) ads. You can change your choice at any time in your device's Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Tracking.</p>

            <h3>4.2 Ad Personalization (Android)</h3>
            <p>On Android devices, AdMob may use your Advertising ID to personalize ads. You can reset or opt out of ad personalization in your device's Settings &gt; Google &gt; Ads.</p>

            <h3>4.3 App Store Privacy Labels</h3>
            <p>The following data may be collected and linked to your identity, and may be used for tracking, as disclosed in our App Store privacy labels:</p>
            <table>
                <thead>

            <!-- ============================================================ -->
            <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>

            <h3>5.1 Local Storage</h3>
            <p>Most personal data — including your profile (name, birth date, birth place), dream history, oracle (e.g. Eight Ball) history, horoscope cache, and notification preferences — is stored only on your device using local storage (on-device files and preferences). A small amount of app configuration (e.g. subscription tier, selected provider) may also be stored on device using Flutter Secure Storage (Keychain on iOS, EncryptedSharedPreferences on Android).</p>

            <h3>5.2 Cloud Processing</h3>
            <p>When you use AI-powered features, your inputs are transmitted to OpenAI's servers for processing and image generation. These transmissions are ephemeral: we do not maintain a permanent server-side database of your dreams, questions, or horoscope requests.</p>

            <h3>5.3 Security Measures</h3>
            <p>We use industry-standard security measures to protect your data, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTTPS (TLS encryption) for all data transmitted between the App and third-party services.</li>
                <li>OS-level secure storage (Keychain on iOS, EncryptedSharedPreferences on Android) for sensitive data stored on your device.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While we take reasonable steps to protect your information, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

            <!-- ============================================================ -->
            <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>Data stored locally on your device persists until you delete the App or clear the App's data. We do not retain your personal data on our servers.</p>
            <p>Third-party services (Google AdMob, Firebase, OpenAI) may retain data they collect according to their own retention policies. Please refer to their respective privacy policies linked in Section 3 above.</p>

            <!-- ============================================================ -->
            <h2>7. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
            <p>The App itself does not use cookies. However, third-party SDKs integrated into the App (AdMob and Firebase) may use device identifiers, advertising identifiers, and similar tracking technologies to collect data as described in Sections 3 and 4. These technologies function similarly to cookies and are used for advertising, analytics, and performance monitoring.</p>

            <!-- ============================================================ -->
            <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
            <p>Your data may be transferred to and processed in countries outside your country of residence, including the United States, where our third-party service providers (Google and OpenAI) maintain servers. These transfers are necessary to provide the App's services. Where required by law, we rely on appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) adopted by the European Commission, or the service provider's certification under applicable data transfer frameworks.</p>

            <!-- ============================================================ -->
            <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Gertruda is rated 13+ and is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@gertruda.fun">privacy@gertruda.fun</a>, and we will take steps to delete such information.</p>
            <p>If you are between 13 and the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you should review this Privacy Policy with a parent or guardian to ensure you understand it.</p>

            <!-- ============================================================ -->
